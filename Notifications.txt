Just a reminder that you can optionally enable your script to announce realtime DClone status changes so that you're not caught off guard. 
See the "DClone Status Alarms" section on Github for more info. 

Consider saying thanks to Mysterio who provides DClone & TZ data for not only this script but for many of the Discord channels you probably use (including D2r Clone Hunters).
Say thanks to them here: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/d2emu",
